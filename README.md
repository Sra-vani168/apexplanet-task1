This is a simple web project created as part of my ApexPlanet internship Task 1. It includes basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a basic web page.
HTML – for structuring the webpage using tags and elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, etc.
CSS – for styling the page (colors, fonts, layout).
JavaScript – for adding basic interactivity and functionality.
##What I Learned##
Writing clean and structured HTML
Styling elements with CSS
Adding simple scripts with JavaScript
