This is a simple web project created as part of my ApexPlanet internship Task 1. It includes basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a basic web page.
HTML â€“ for structuring the webpage using tags and elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, etc.
CSS â€“ for styling the page (colors, fonts, layout).
JavaScript â€“ for adding basic interactivity and functionality.
